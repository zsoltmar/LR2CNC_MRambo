# LR2CNC_MRambo
Altering the Marlin firmware for the Lowrider2 CNC

This is a work in progress. I'll only be focusing on the Mini Rambo board as this is what I currently have. I'm merely sharing my configuration if anyone sees any use for it.

Current changes list:
- Removed extruder temp display on status screen
- Removed fan icon
- Removed temperatures menu item
- Arranged for the XYZ coordinates to take over the top part of the status screen
- Moved auto home menu item 3 spaces below the motion menu to avoid accidental triggering
- Added custom gcodes to engage and disengage the axis separately and altogether
- Enabled the games :)
